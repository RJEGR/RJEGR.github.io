I am a biotechnology engineer, with experience in performing data analysis for data-driven decision-making. I gained my Master degree with a focus on Cellular and Molecular Microbiology data analysis. Most recently I obtained my doctoral degree in Coastal Oceanographic doing a research focused in the big-data analysis related to an aquaculture resource facing climate change. My network of collaborators includes researchers in the field of marine science, aquaculture, microbiology and biomedicine. Therefore, I am a programmer, expert in Linux and R languages. Devoted learner of SQL, Python and Perl. I like collaborating in the Git community and work from supercomputing and cloud computing plataforms. Adittionally, I have acquired proficient experience in processing samples for molecular procedures such as DNA/RNA extraction, library preparation for next generation sequencing and qPCR.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.
